# Description

The purpose of this repository is to provide scripts that prepare images for training models, that
are intended to generate images as close to them as possible.

The repository contains scripts such as:
* `image_downloader.py` - this script is used to download images from three of the 
most popular anime image galleries: Safebooru, Danbooru and Gelbooru and save them to a selected/created folder.
* `new_image_detect` - this script is used to extract faces from downloaded images and save them to a selected/created folder. 
If you want to fine-tune models using the Dreambooth technique, it is best to practice these models using face images.
* `image_to_text` - this script is used to create descriptions for selected images. 
Dreambooth technique gives better results when texts are added to the exercise in addition to images.
* `main` - this script is used to run other scripts.
* `const` - script with constants.

In the `original_anime90_image` there are taken (resized, background removed,which is currently done manually) 
pictures of 90s style anime characters.

The `ai_image` folder contains examples of images generated by the trained model. 

The images were obtained using the Dreambooth technique.
